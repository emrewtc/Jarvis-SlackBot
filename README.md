# Jarvis-SlackBot

Jarvis is a [Slack](https://slack.com) bot, built with [SlackKit](https://github.com/pvzig/SlackKit) using Swift.

* Jarvis can 
  * greet the channel which he joined.
  * welcome people who just joined the channel.
  * share a random gif from [GIPHY](http://giphy.com/) when someone mentioned him.


Replace your botâ€™s API token with `xoxb-YOUR_SLACK_API_TOKEN` in `JarvisBot.swift` in order to run Jarvis on [Slack](https://slack.com)
```swift 
let kSlackToken = "xoxb-YOUR_SLACK_API_TOKEN"
```
